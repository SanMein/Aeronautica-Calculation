# I would like to present to you my mini-project for pilots, which makes it easier to understand the descent and increase in altitude - Pilot Flight Calculator
*What is this project?*
- Quite simple and intuitive to use mini-site, in which you can easily and simply understand what and how to do here.
- You can set up measurement systems yourself - In speed: kts, mph, km / h, m / s; In altitude: ft, m; In distance: km, mi, nmi. This makes the site ideally convenient.
- The functionality of the page is as follows: Enter the current altitude and the required one, then enter the speed and angle according to ADI (positive or negative value) using the slider, and you are given three results: Approximate vertical speed of descent or increase in altitude, Time to overcome to the required altitude and Horizontal distance that will be overcome to the point of the required altitude.
- Each calculation is done automatically and immediately, so you don't have to click on the "calculate" button or anything like that.
- There are already existing "Profiles": Custom (for your own customization), Standard Approach (for a realistic approach, which is specified according to international standards), Short Field Landing (for fast and short flights (preferably not on jet aircraft)) and Climb Out (for takeoff of any international aircraft).
